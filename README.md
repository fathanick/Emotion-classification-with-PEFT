# Emotion Classification with PEFT

This repository implements **Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** techniques, specifically **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, for emotion classification in Indonesian texts. The project leverages datasets and state-of-the-art natural language processing models to achieve efficient and effective fine-tuning.
